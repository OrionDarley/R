#1. Unemployment rate is an important macroeconomic series. 
#Equivalent importance is the duration of unemployment. Consider the mean duration of 
#unemployment is the U.S. from January 1948 to March 2014. The duration is measured in weeks. 
#The data are available from FRED of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis 
#and also in the file m-unempmean.txt. The data were seasonally adjusted.

#(a) Does the mean duration series have a unit root? Why?

tdx=unemploy[,1]+unemploy[,2]/12
dur=unemploy$Value

plot(tdx,dur,type='l',xlab='Year',ylab='Duration',
     main='Mean Duration of Unemployment', col = "steelblue2")

#ts.unemploy <- ts(unemploy, start = c(1948,1), frequency = 12) # do no use, because data already has dates

plot(pacf(dur), col = "sienna1", lwd = 2)

plot(acf(diff(dur)), col = "brown2", lwd = 2)
plot(pacf(diff(dur)), col = "brown2", lwd = 2)

m1=ar(diff(dur),method="mle")
m1$order

adf.test(dur, alternative = "stationary")

#(b) Focus on the change series of duration, i.e. the first differenced series. 
#Denote the change series by rt and let E(rt) = µ. Test H0 : µ = 0 versus the alternative Ha : µ != 0. Draw the conclusion.

ddur=diff(dur)
t.test(ddur) 

#(c) Build an AR model for rt series. Perform model checking using gof = 24. Is the model adequate? Why?

m2=arima(ddur,order=c(12,0,0),include.mean=F)
m2

tsdiag(m2,gof=24)

Box.test(ddur,lag=24,type='Ljung')
acf(m2$residuals, 25)
pacf(m2$residuals, 25)

#(d) Write down the fitted AR model.

#(1 + 0.1351(xt-1) + 0.1134(xt-2) + 0.1083(xt-3) + 0.1165(xt-4) + 0.0738(xt-5)
#+ 0.0770(xt-6) + 0.0903(xt-7) - 0.0609(xt-8) + 0.0687(xt-9) + 0.0609(xt-10)  + 0.0228(xt-11) - 0.0723(xt-12) = at

#(e) Fit a seasonal model for the rt series using the command

ms=arima(ddur,order=c(2,0,1),seasonal=list(order=c(1,0,1),period=12),include.mean=F)
ms

acf(ms$residuals, 25)
pacf(ms$residuals, 25)

Box.test(residuals(ms), lag = 12, fitdf = 5, type = "Ljung")
Box.test(residuals(ms), lag = 12, fitdf = 5, type = "Ljung")

#Perform model checking using gof = 24. Is the seasonal model adequate? Why?

tsdiag(ms,gof=24)

#(f) Based on the in-sample fitting, which model is preferred? Why?

#(g) Consider out-of-sample predictions. Use t = 750 as the starting forecast origin. 
#Which model is preferred based on the out-of-sample predictions?

dim(unemploy)

backtest(m2,ddur,750,1,inc.mean=F)
backtest(ms,ddur,750,1,inc.mean=F)

#2. (Commodity prices). Consider the weekly crude oil prices: West Texas Intermediate 
#(WTI), Cushing, Oklahoma. The data are also available from FRED and in the file w-coilwtico.txt. 
#The sample period is from January 3, 1986 to April 2, 2014.

    "\nJanuary 3, 1986 to April 2, 2014"), col = 'steelblue')

#(a) Let rt be the growth series, i.e. the first difference of log oil prices. 
#Is there serial correlation in the rt series? You may use Q(10) to draw the conclusion.

acf(diff(log(coil)))
par(mfcol = c(1, 1))

rtn = diff(log(coil))
t.test(rtn)

Box.test(rtn,lag=10,type='Ljung')

#(b) Build an AR model for rt. Check the adequacy of the model, and write down the model.

ts.coil <- ts(coil, start = c(1986,1), end = c(2014,4), frequency = 12)
plot(diff(ts.coil))
plot(diff(diff(ts.coil)))

ma <- auto.arima(rtn, trace = TRUE, stationary = TRUE); ma
tsdiag(ma,gof=24) 
adf.test(rtn, alternative = "stationary")

#(c) Fit another model to rt using the following command

m5=arima(rt,order=c(3,0,2),include.mean=F)
m5

tsdiag(m5,gof=24) 
adf.test(rtn, alternative = "stationary")
